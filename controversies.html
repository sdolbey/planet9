          In the year of 2006, when Pluto was demoted to Dwarf Planet, the main reasoning behind it was due to the planet not having a clear orbit aka <a href="https://www.ucf.edu/news/pluto-planet-research/">be the largest gravitational force in its orbit</a><em>. </em>A few years fast forward, Dr. Philip Metzger who has made a massive impact in the space community as well as being a UCF alumni and planetary scientist at the University, reopened the discussion that the reasoning behind pluto&#x27;s demotion was uncalled for and called for a changing in the definition of a planet. Metzger says that “the definition of a planet should be based on its intrinsic properties, rather than ones that can change, such as the dynamics of a planet’s orbit.” Metzger recommends classifying a planet on whether or not it&#x27;s a spherical shape in space. He also discusses the habitat of Pluto stating how it has a much wider diversity in its ecosystem compared to Mars.

          According to Alan Stern, principal investigator with NASA’s New Horizons mission to Pluto, <a href=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/14489259>there are technical reasons why the 2006 IAU definition of a planet isn’t adequate.</a> He says the third condition, which states that a planet must “have cleared the neighborhood around its orbit”, is vague, and that Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Neptune have not cleared their neighborhoods either. Earth, for example, co-orbits with 10,000 near-Earth asteroids. He argues that, “If Neptune had cleared its zone, Pluto wouldn’t be there.”

          Philip Metzger, planetary scientist and University of Central Florida lecturer, <a href=https://www.orlandoweekly.com/Blogs/archives/2018/09/12/a-florida-scientist-wants-to-make-pluto-a-planet-again>also takes issue with the clearing your neighborhood requirement.</a> He argues that no planet actually clears its orbit, so therefore there are no planets.
