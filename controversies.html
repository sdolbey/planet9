          In the year of 2006, when Pluto was demoted to Dwarf Planet, the main reasoning behind it was due to the planet not having a clear orbit aka <a href="https://www.ucf.edu/news/pluto-planet-research/">be the largest gravitational force in its orbit</a><em>. </em>A few years fast forward, Dr. Philip Metzger who has made a massive impact in the space community as well as being a UCF alumni and planetary scientist at the University, reopened the discussion that the reasoning behind pluto&#x27;s demotion was uncalled for and called for a changing in the definition of a planet. Metzger says that “the definition of a planet should be based on its intrinsic properties, rather than ones that can change, such as the dynamics of a planet’s orbit.” Metzger recommends classifying a planet on whether or not it&#x27;s a spherical shape in space. He also discusses the habitat of Pluto stating how it has a much wider diversity in its ecosystem compared to Mars.
